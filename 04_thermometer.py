# This project uses a thermistor, a component whose resistance varies with the temperature.
# To measure its resistance, the code records the time it takes for a capacitor to fill  
# when supplied by a current passing through the resistor. The lower the resistance the faster 
# it fills up. 
#
# You can think of a capacitor as a tank of electricity, and as it fills with charge, the voltage
# across it increases. We cannot measure that voltage directly, because the Raspberry Pi
# does not have an analog to digital convertor (ADC or analog input). However, we can time how long it
# takes for the capacitor to fill with charge to the extent that it gets above the 1.65V or so
# that counts as being a high digital input. 
# 
# For more information on this technique take a look at: 
# learn.adafruit.com/basic-resistor-sensor-reading-on-raspberry-pi
# The code here is based on that in the Raspberry Pi Cookbook (Recipes 12.1 to 12.3)
